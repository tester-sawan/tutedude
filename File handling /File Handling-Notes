1. In python, file are managed into two types 1. Text File 2. Binary File
2. Text file are files that stores data in the form of characters.
3. Any files that stores data in bytes(8bits) is called Binary files.
4. How do we open a file in python:
    . For opening file in python, we have open(<file_name>,<mode_to_open>) function and should be stored in a variable as shown in example.
    . Modes are: r(read),x(create),w(write/overwrite),a(append),t(text_file),b(binary_file)
    . When open, the pointer will be at top.
    . Eg: file_handler = open("practice.txt","tr") where t stand for text mode and r stand for read mode
    .     print(file_handler)
5. When open a file, make sure file should be close to prevent from data loss.
    . How to close a file, a function called close() function.
    . eg: file_handler.close()
6. How to create a file:
    . To create a file, follow the same operation as opening the file using open("new_file_name.txt","xt"), where x stands for create and t stand for text.
    . If the python doesn't find the file , then it will create a new file with the name given in argument.
    . eg: file1 = open("newfile.txt","xt")
7. To write something into the new file we will use the write() and pass the argument i.e. content as string into it.
    . eg: file1.write("Welcome to the file handling.\n")
    . eg: file1.write("This is creating a new file.")
8.  . w mode is used to open a file in write mode. This will overwrite the existing file.
    . As we open the file in w mode, the content of the file will be deleted and ready for overwriting.
        openfile=open("file1.txt","wt")
        openfile.write("This file is overwritten using the w modes.\n")
        openfile.write("Have a great day.")
        openfile.close()

9. How to read a file in python.
    . read() used to read the file contents as "String."
