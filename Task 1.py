Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
'''
# Code starts from here
# Took two numbers as input from the users.
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number : "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number : "))
Addition = num1 + num2
Substraction = num1-num2
Multiplication = num1 * num2
Division = num1/num2
print("Addition : ",Addition)
print("Substraction : ",Substraction)
print("Multiplication : ",Multiplication)
print("Division : ",Division)
